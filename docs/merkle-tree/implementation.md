## 1. Calculating the Merkle Root Recursively üå≥

The Merkle root is the top-most node of a Merkle tree, representing the combined hash of all the data blocks. Let's break down how you can calculate it recursively.

### Recursive Merkle Root Calculation

**Visual Steps:**

- **Step 1**: Start with your data blocks and hash each one to create the leaf nodes.
  
  ```text
  Data Blocks: [D1, D2, D3, '']  ‚Üê Pad the base layer if the number of data is not N**2
  Leaf Nodes:  [H1, H2, H3, H4]  ‚Üê Hash each data block
  ```

- **Step 2**: Combine each pair of hashes to create the next level of the tree.
  
  ```text
      Level 1:  [H1, H2, H3, H4]
      Combine:  H1 + H2 = A,  H3 + H4 = B
      Hash the combination: [Hash(A), Hash(B)]  ‚Üê List it to the parent level hashes
  ```

- **Step 3**: Recursively repeat this process until you have a single hash, the Merkle root.

  ```text
  Final Level:
        Root
         |
         A + B = Root Hash
  ```

### Visual Example

Here's what the recursive process looks like:

```text
  Level 1:   H1    H2    H3    H4    ‚Üê Hashes of data blocks
              \   /      \   /
  Level 2:   Hash(A)     Hash(B)           ‚Üê Combine hashes to form next level
                 \     /
  Root Level:     Root Hash          ‚Üê Combine recursively to get the final Merkle root
```

## 2. Generating a Proof üîç

A Merkle proof allows you to verify that a specific data block is part of a Merkle tree. Let‚Äôs visually explore how to generate this proof.

### Generating a Proof

**Visual Steps:**

- **Step 1**: Identify the path from the target leaf node (your data block) to the root.
  
  ```text
  Example: To prove that H2 is part of the tree:
  
  Path: H2 ‚Üí A ‚Üí Root
  ```

- **Step 2**: Collect the hashes of the sibling nodes along this path.
  
  ```text
  Siblings Needed: H1 (sibling of H2), B (sibling of A)
  ```

### Visual Example

Here's a diagram to illustrate generating a proof:

```text
        Root Hash
           /  \
         A      B
        / \    / \
      H1  H2  H3  H4

  Proof for H2:
  1. Start at H2.
  2. Collect sibling H1.
  3. Move to parent A and collect its sibling B.
  4. Reach the root.

  Proof Path: [H1, B]
```

## 3. Validating a Proof ‚úÖ

After generating a proof, you can validate that a data block is indeed part of the Merkle tree. Here‚Äôs how this validation works visually.

### Validating a Proof

**Visual Steps:**

- **Step 1**: Begin with the hash of the data block you're validating.
  
  ```text
  Start with: H2
  ```

- **Step 2**: Combine this hash with the sibling hashes from the proof, following the order used to create the tree.
  
  ```text
  Combine: H1 + H2 = A,  A + B = Root
  ```

- **Step 3**: Compare the resulting hash with the stored Merkle root.

### Visual Example

```text
        Root Hash
           /  \
         A      B
        / \    / \
      H1  H2  H3  H4

  Validating H2:
  1. Start with H2.
  2. Combine with H1 to get A.
  3. Combine A with B to get the root.
  4. If the root matches, H2 is validated.
```

## 4. Working with Compact Multiproofs üì¶

Compact multiproofs allow you to prove the inclusion of multiple data blocks in a Merkle tree more efficiently. Let‚Äôs explore this concept visually.

### Generating a Compact Multiproof

**Visual Steps:**

- **Step 1**: Select the indices of the data blocks you want to prove.
  
  ```text
  Example: We want to prove H2 and H3.
  ```

- **Step 2**: Collect only the necessary sibling hashes required to prove all the selected blocks.
  
  ```text
  Siblings Needed: H1 (for H2), H4 (for H3)
  ```

### Visual Example

```text
        Root Hash
           /  \
         A      B
        / \    / \
      H1  H2  H3  H4

  Compact Multiproof for H2 and H3:
  1. Start at H2 and H3.
  2. Collect necessary siblings: H1 and H4.
  3. Combine them as needed to validate both paths to the root.

  Proof Path: [H1, H4]
```

### Validating a Compact Multiproof

**Visual Steps:**

- **Step 1**: Reconstruct the hashes for each subtree from the provided blocks and proof.
  
  ```text
  Combine: H1 + H2 = A,  H3 + H4 = B
  ```

- **Step 2**: Compare the resulting root hash with the stored Merkle root.

### Visual Example

```text
        Root Hash
           /  \
         A      B
        / \    / \
      H1  H2  H3  H4

  Validating with Compact Multiproof:
  1. Reconstruct A from H1 and H2.
  2. Reconstruct B from H3 and H4.
  3. Combine A and B to get the root.
  4. If the root matches, the blocks are validated.
```
