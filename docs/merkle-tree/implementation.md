## 1. Calculating the Merkle Root Recursively üå≥

The Merkle root is the top-most node of a Merkle tree, representing the combined hash of all the data blocks. Here's how you can calculate it recursively:

### Recursive Merkle Root Calculation

To calculate the Merkle root:

- **Step 1**: Hash each data block to create the leaf nodes.
- **Step 2**: Combine each pair of hashes to form the next level.
- **Step 3**: Recursively repeat this process until you reach the root.

### Example Code

```rust
fn calculate_merkle_root_rec(hashes: Vec<HashValue>) -> HashValue {
    match hashes.len() {
        0 => 0, // Return 0 if no hashes
        1 => hashes[0], // Only one hash, return it as the root
        _ => {
            let mut parent_level_hashes = Vec::new();

            for pair in hashes.chunks(2) {
                match pair.len() {
                    1 => parent_level_hashes.push(pair[0]), // Handle odd number of elements
                    _ => parent_level_hashes.push(concatenate_hash_values(pair[0], pair[1])),
                }
            }

            calculate_merkle_root_rec(parent_level_hashes) // Recursive call for the parent level
        }
    }
}
```

### How It Works

- **Base Case**: If there's only one hash, that's the root.
- **Recursive Case**: Combine each pair of hashes and recursively calculate the parent level until you reach the root.

## 2. Generating a Proof üîç

A Merkle proof allows you to verify that a particular data block is part of a Merkle tree. Here's how to generate a proof:

### Generating a Proof

- **Step 1**: Find the path from the leaf node (your data block) to the root.
- **Step 2**: Collect the hashes of the sibling nodes along the path.



Sure! Here's the continuation:

### Example Code (continued)

```rust
        let sibling_idx = if is_right_sibling { idx + 1 } else { idx - 1 };

        if is_right_sibling {
            proof.push(SiblingNode::Right(hashes[sibling_idx]));
        } else {
            proof.push(SiblingNode::Left(hashes[sibling_idx]));
        }

        idx /= 2;

        let mut next_level = Vec::new();
        for pair in hashes.chunks(2) {
            next_level.push(concatenate_hash_values(pair[0], pair[1]));
        }
        hashes = next_level;
    }

    (hashes[0], proof) // Returns the root and the proof (sibling nodes)
}
```

### How It Works

- **Path to Root**: The function traverses from the data block (leaf node) to the root, collecting the hashes of sibling nodes along the way.
- **Proof Structure**: The proof is a list of these sibling nodes, which can later be used to verify that the data block is part of the tree.

## 3. Validating a Proof ‚úÖ

Once you've generated a proof, you can use it to verify that a data block is indeed part of the Merkle tree. Here's how:

### Validating a Proof

- **Step 1**: Start with the hash of the data block.
- **Step 2**: Combine it with the hashes from the proof, following the same order they were combined in the tree.
- **Step 3**: Compare the resulting hash with the Merkle root.

### Example Code

```rust
pub fn validate_proof(root: &HashValue, word: &str, proof: MerkleProof) -> bool {
    let mut hash = hash(&word);

    for node in proof {
        hash = match node {
            SiblingNode::Left(sibling_hash) => concatenate_hash_values(sibling_hash, hash),
            SiblingNode::Right(sibling_hash) => concatenate_hash_values(hash, sibling_hash),
        };
    }

    hash == *root // Returns true if the reconstructed hash matches the root
}
```

### How It Works

- **Reconstruction**: The function reconstructs the hash from the data block using the proof and compares it with the root.
- **Validation**: If the reconstructed hash matches the root, the data block is validated as part of the tree.

## 4. Working with Compact Multiproofs üì¶

Compact multiproofs allow you to prove the inclusion of multiple data blocks in a Merkle tree more efficiently than generating individual proofs for each block.

### Generating a Compact Multiproof

- **Step 1**: Identify the indices of the data blocks you want to prove.
- **Step 2**: Collect the minimal set of sibling hashes required to verify all the specified blocks.


### Validating a Compact Multiproof

- **Step 1**: Reconstruct the hash of the subtree from the provided blocks and proof.
- **Step 2**: Compare the resulting hash with the Merkle root.
