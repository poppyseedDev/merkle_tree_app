# Welcome to the Rust Merkle Tree Project! 🚀

Are you new to Rust and looking for a hands-on project to build your skills? You've come to the right place! This guide will walk you through creating a Rust-based client-server application that uses Merkle trees to ensure file integrity. 🌳

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this guide, you'll have a solid understanding of:

- **Rust Project Structure**: How to organize and structure your Rust projects.
- **Merkle Trees**: Implementing a Merkle tree from scratch, including generating and verifying proofs.
- **Client-Server Interaction**: Building a client-server application with REST APIs.
- **Docker**: Containerizing your application for easy deployment and testing.

### Steps to Follow

1. **Set Up the Rust Project** 🛠️
   - Learn how to initialize a new Rust project and set up the structure for both client and server applications.

2. **Implement the Merkle Tree** 🌳
   - Dive into creating a Merkle Tree that supports building the tree from file hashes, generating proofs, and verifying them against the root hash.

3. **Client Implementation** 📤
   - Implement the client-side logic for uploading files, computing the Merkle root, and verifying downloaded files using Merkle proofs.

4. **Server Implementation** 📥
   - Learn to build the server-side components for storing files, handling requests, and generating Merkle proofs on demand.

5. **Networking** 🌐
   - Set up REST APIs to handle communication between the client and server, managing file uploads, downloads, and proof requests.

6. **Docker Setup** 🐳
   - Containerize your client and server applications using Docker and Docker Compose for streamlined deployment and testing.
